<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This tetris clone was extremely fun to work on and was a way for me to challenge myself as I approach the last couple weeks of my time with Hack Reactor.

The project started out as a dream after watching my seniors (2207) present their MVP ideas. The projects that really stood out to me were the 2 students who made "games", one in the vein of space invaders and the other was a flying simulator that used machine learning and ai to generate random obstacles a player would have to fly around. I didn't think I would be able to do a game as complicated as that but I did start looking into other game alternatives and came across the idea of making tetris (also our seniors loved tetrio).

After finding some tutorials I was able to use all that I've learned in the bootcamp to create this fullstack game clone Not Tetris. I really hope you enjoy!
